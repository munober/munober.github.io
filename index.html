Welcome to fratiloiu.com

This is currently very much a work in progress.
This website serves 3 main purposes.

1. having my resume available on the internet;
2. keeping an open collection of some of my creative work;
3. having a contact form that leads directly to my inbox;

You can also find a list of books I have recently read or am planning to read soon.

Also, pretty much everybody who isnâ€™t a native speaker of Romanian will have trouble pronouncing my last name.
It kinda goes like this: fra-ti-low-you.
