Welcome to fratiloiu.com \n
\n
This is currently very much a work in progress. \n
This website serves 3 main purposes. \n
\n
1. having my resume available on the internet; \n
2. keeping an open collection of some of my creative work; \n
3. having a contact form that leads directly to my inbox; \n
\n
You can also find a list of books I have recently read or am planning to read soon. \n
\n
Also, pretty much everybody who isnâ€™t a native speaker of Romanian will have trouble pronouncing my last name. \n
It kinda goes like this: fra-ti-low-you.
