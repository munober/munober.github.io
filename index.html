                Welcome to fratiloiu.com <br />        
                <br />
                This place is currently very much a work in progress. <br />
                And yet serves its 3 main purposes already. <br />
                <br />
                1. having my 
                <a href='https://fratnotes.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/teodor-fratiloiu-resume-private.pdf'
                target="_blank">
                resume</a> 
                available on the internet; <br />
                2. keeping an 
                <a href= 'https://fratnotes.wordpress.com/work/'
                target="_blank">
                open collection
                </a>
                of some of my creative work; <br />
                3. putting out my email address: 
                <a href= 'mailto:teo@fratiloiu.com'
                target="_blank">
                teo@fratiloiu.com</a>;<br />
                <br />
                You can also find a 
                <a href= 'https://fratiloiu.com/reading/'
                target="_blank">
                list of books</a> I have recently read or am planning to read soon. <br />
                <br />
                Also, pretty much everybody who isnâ€™t a native speaker of Romanian will have trouble pronouncing my last name. <br />
                It kinda goes like this: fray-tee-low-you.<br />
